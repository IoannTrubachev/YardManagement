## Requirements

* **PHP 5.3.7+**, PHP 5.4+ or PHP 5.5+
* **MySQL 5** database (better use versions 5.5+ as very old versions have a [PDO injection bug](http://stackoverflow.com/q/134099/1114320)
* installed PHP extensions: pdo, gd, openssl (the tutorial shows how to do)
* installed tools on your server: git, curl, composer (the tutorial shows how to do)
* for professional mail sending: an SMTP account (I use [SMTP2GO](http://www.smtp2go.com/?s=devmetal))
* activated mod_rewrite on your server (the tutorial shows how to do)

Also make sure you know the basics of object-oriented programming and MVC, are able to use the command line and have
used Composer before. This script is not for beginners.
